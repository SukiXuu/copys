/*  Write a program that requests the user to enter a Fahrenheit temperature. The program
should read the temperature as a type double number and pass it as an argument to
a user-supplied function called Temperatures(). This function should calculate the
Celsius equivalent and the Kelvin equivalent and display all three temperatures with a
precision of two places to the right of the decimal. It should identify each value with the
temperature scale it represents. Here is the formula for converting Fahrenheit to Celsius:
Celsius = 5.0 / 9.0 * (Fahrenheit - 32.0)
The Kelvin scale, commonly used in science, is a scale in which 0 represents absolute
zero, the lower limit to possible temperatures. Here is the formula for converting Celsius
to Kelvin:
Kelvin = Celsius + 273.16
The Temperatures() function should use const to create symbolic representations of
the three constants that appear in the conversions. The main() function should use
a loop to allow the user to enter temperatures repeatedly, stopping when a q or other
nonnumeric value is entered. Use the fact that scanf() returns the number of items
read, so it will return 1 if it reads a number, but it won’t return 1 if the user enters q. The
== operator tests for equality, so you can use it to compare the return value of scanf()
with 1. */
